* Freescale low power universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter (lpuart)

Required properties:
- compatible :
  - "fsl,vf610-lpuart" for lpuart compatible with the one integrated
    on Vybrid vf610 SoC with 8-bit register organization
  - "fsl,ls1021a-lpuart" for lpuart compatible with the one integrated
    on LS1021A SoC with 32-bit big-endian register organization
  - "fsl,imx7ulp-lpuart" for lpuart compatible with the one integrated
    on i.MX7ULP SoC with 32-bit little-endian register organization
  - "fsl,imx8qm-lpuart"for lpuart  compatible with the one integrated
    on i.MX8QM SoC with 32-bit little-endian register organization, which
    is based on i.MX7ULP lpuart IP but add EEOP new feature.
- reg : Address and length of the register set for the device
- interrupts : Should contain uart interrupt
- clocks : phandle + clock specifier pairs, one for each entry in clock-names
- clock-names : should contain: "ipg" - the uart peripheral register accessing
  clock source, if "per" clock missing, the "ipg" clock also is the uart module
  clock.

Optional properties:
- dmas: A list of two dma specifiers, one for each entry in dma-names.
- dma-names: should contain "tx" and "rx".
- clocks : phandle + clock specifier pairs, one for each entry in clock-names
- clock-names : "per" - the uart module clock.
  clock.

Note: Optional properties for DMA support. Write them both or both not.

Example:

uart0: serial@40027000 {
		compatible = "fsl,vf610-lpuart";
		reg = <0x40027000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 61 0x00>;
		clocks = <&clks VF610_CLK_UART0>;
		clock-names = "ipg";
		dmas = <&edma0 0 2>,
			<&edma0 0 3>;
		dma-names = "rx","tx";
	};
