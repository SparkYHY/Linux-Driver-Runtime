Raydium RM67171 OLED LCD panel with MIPI-DSI protocol

Required properties:
- compatible: 		"raydium,rm67191"
- reg:			virtual channel for MIPI-DSI protocol
			must be <0>
- dsi-lanes:		number of DSI lanes to be used
			must be <3> or <4>
- port: 		input port node with endpoint definition as
			defined in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt;
			the input port should be connected to a MIPI-DSI device
			driver

Optional properties:
- reset-gpio:		a GPIO spec for the RST_B GPIO pin
- display-timings:	timings for the connected panel according to [1]
- pinctrl-0		phandle to the pin settings for the reset pin
- panel-width-mm:	physical panel width [mm]
- panel-height-mm:	physical panel height [mm]
- video-mode:		Video data transfer mode
			must be <0>, <1> or <2> as
			follows:
			    <0>: Burst mode
			    <1>: Non-burst mode with sync event
			    <2>: Non-burst mode with sync pulse
