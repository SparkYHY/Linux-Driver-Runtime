Freescale i.MX audio complex with WM8960 codec

Required properties:

  - compatible		: "fsl,imx-audio-wm8960", "fsl,imx7d-evk-wm8960"

  - model		: The user-visible name of this sound complex

  - cpu-dai		: The phandle of CPU DAI

  - audio-codec		: The phandle of the WM8960 audio codec

  - audio-routing	: A list of the connections between audio components.
			  Each entry is a pair of strings, the first being the
			  connection's sink, the second being the connection's
			  source. Valid names could be power supplies, WM8960
			  pins, and the jacks on the board:

			  Power supplies:
			   * Mic Bias

			  Board connectors:
			   * Mic Jack
			   * Headphone Jack
			   * Ext Spk

Optional properties:
- hp-det-gpios : The gpio pin to detect plug in/out event that happens to
  Headphone jack.
- mic-det-gpios: The gpio pin to detect plug in/out event that happens to
  Microphone jack.
