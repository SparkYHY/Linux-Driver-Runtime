PTN5150 Extcon device

NXP PTN5150 is an i2c interface Type-C application chip, it can detect
CC flip, attach and detech, the user can get these events through
i2c registers by GPIO interrupt.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "nxp,ptn5150"
- connect-gpios: gpio interrupt for attach and detach events.
- reg: i2c slave address

Example:
&i2c1 {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	clock-frequency = <100000>;
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_lpi2c1>;
	status = "okay";

	typec_ptn5150: typec@3d {
		compatible = "nxp,ptn5150";
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_ptn5150>;
		reg = <0x3d>;
		connect-gpios = <&gpio1 7 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
	};
};
