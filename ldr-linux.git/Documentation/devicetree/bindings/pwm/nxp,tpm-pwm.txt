NXP TPM PWM controller

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "nxp,tpm-pwm"
- reg: physical base address and length of the controller's registers
- #pwm-cells: should be 2. See pwm.txt in this directory for a description of
  the cells format.
- nxp,pwm-number: the number of PWM devices

Example:

pwm0: tpm@40250000 {
	compatible = "nxp,tpm-pwm";
	reg = <0x40250000 0x1000>;
	nxp,pwm-number = <6>;
	#pwm-cells = <2>;
};
