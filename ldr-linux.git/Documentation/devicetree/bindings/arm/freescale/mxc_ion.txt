ION Memory Manager (ION)

ION is a memory manager that allows for sharing of buffers between different
processes and between user space and kernel space. ION manages different
memory spaces by separating the memory spaces into "heaps".

Required properties for Ion

- compatible: "fsl,mxc-ion"


All child nodes of a fsl,mxc-ion node are interpreted as Ion heap
configurations.

Required properties for Ion heaps

- fsl,heap-id: The ID of the ION heap.

Example:
  imx_ion {
    compatible = "fsl,mxc-ion";
    fsl,heap-id = <0>;
  };
