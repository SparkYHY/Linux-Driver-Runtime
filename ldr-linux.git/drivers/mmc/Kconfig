menuconfig MMC
	tristate "MMC/SD/SDIO card support"
	depends on HAS_IOMEM
	help
	  This selects MultiMediaCard, Secure Digital and Secure
	  Digital I/O support.

	  If you want MMC/SD/SDIO support, you should say Y here and
	  also to your specific host controller driver.

config MMC_MQ_DEFAULT
	bool "MMC: use blk-mq I/O path by default"
	depends on MMC && BLOCK
	default y
	---help---
	  This option enables the new blk-mq based I/O path for MMC block
	  devices by default.  With the option the mmc_core.use_blk_mq
	  module/boot option defaults to Y, without it to N, but it can
	  still be overridden either way.
