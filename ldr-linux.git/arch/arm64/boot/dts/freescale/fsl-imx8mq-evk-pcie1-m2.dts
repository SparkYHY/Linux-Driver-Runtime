/*
 * NOTE:
 * 1. The DTS file only support i.MX8MQ EVK RevB1/B2 board PCIe M.2 Murata
 *    1CQ (Qca6174) WIFI & BT.
 *    EVK RevB1 rework:
 *	WIFI rework: fly line from R1436 (near to M.2) to R1459
 *	BT rework: ensure R1446,R1447,R1448,R1449 installed on board
 *    EVK RevB2 rework: no rework
 *
 * 2. If need to support i.MX8MQ EVK RevA0/A1 board PCIe M.2 Murata 1CQ
 *    (Qca6174) WIFI & BT, some board rework requirement:
 *    EVK RevA0 rework:
 *	WIFI rework: install R1436 for wlreg_on
 *    EVK RevA0 rework:
 *	WIFI rework: install R1436 for wlreg_on
 *	BT rework: fly line from M.2 pin54 to R1437
 *    Also, below DTS change requirement:
 *	/ {
 *		regulators {
 *			epdev_on: fixedregulator@100 {
 *				compatible = "regulator-fixed";
 *				regulator-min-microvolt = <3300000>;
 *				regulator-max-microvolt = <3300000>;
 *				regulator-name = "epdev_on";
 *				gpio = <&gpio2 19 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
 *				enable-active-high;
 *			};
 *		};
 *	};
 *
 *	&iomuxc {
 *		imx8mq-evk {
 *			pinctrl_epdev_on: epdevongrp {
 *				fsl,pins = <
 *					MX8MQ_IOMUXC_SD2_RESET_B_GPIO2_IO19	0x16
 *				>;
 *			};
 *		};
 *	};
 *
 *	&pcie1{
 *		pinctrl-names = "default";
 *		pinctrl-0 = <&pinctrl_pcie1 &pinctrl_epdev_on>;
 *		epdev_on-supply = <&epdev_on>;
 *	};
 *
 *	&usdhc2 {
 *		status = "disabled";
 *	};
 *
 *
 * 3. When wifi driver switch to QCA CLD from ATH10K, there have two known issues:
 *	- QCA CLD driver only support ONE instance.
 *	- QCA CLD driver don't support PCIe MSI feature.
 *    So here it has to disable pcie0 port.
